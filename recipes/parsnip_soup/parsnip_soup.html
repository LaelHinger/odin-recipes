<h2> Description</h2>
<p>This parsnip soup is rich, creamy, and flavored with roasted veggies, garlic, and aromatic spices to make a flavorsome winter soup.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place parsnips and carrots in a mixing bowl; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables evenly onto a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and parsnips are golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in hot oil until softened and onion is beginning to turn golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in butter, brown sugar, garlic, and roasted parsnips and carrots. Continue to cook and stir until vegetables are very soft and beginning to brown, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Season with ginger, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper; stir for 1 minute. Pour in chicken stock; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get soup moving before leaving it on to purée.</li>
    <li>Pour blended soup into a clean pot. Stir in milk and cream. Return to a simmer over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper to serve.</li>
